# RStudio Code Snippets

Code snippets are an easy-to-use productivity feature that can quickly insert code skeletons for commonly used functions, and can be customized to save you from writing a ton of repetitive code.

For the snippets below, you can use them in your RStudio by copy & pasteing them to `Tools -> Global Options... -> Code -> Edit Snippets`. Note: You may have to delete the `TAB` indentation and re-type it.
